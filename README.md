# React Router v6 Catch-All Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`*`) in React Router v6.  The catch-all route, intended to handle any unmatched paths, appears to be ignored or overridden by other routes.

The problem is described in `bug.js`.  The solution, demonstrating a correct implementation, is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
